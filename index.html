<h1>New Imperialism</h1>
<h2>Examples of Colonial Resistance</h2>
<h3>Pan-Africanism</h3>
<p>At its root, Pan-Africanism is the study of the usage of the abilty that all Africans have: The abiltiy to turn into pans. They used this superpower to try to fight off their colonizers, but they ultimately failed when the British opened a black hole that ate all of Africa.</p>
<h3>Australia</h3>
<p>The British tried their best to colonize Australia, but the couldn't. Their plans kept getting foiled when the Australian natives would roll 50 ton stone boulders towards the British troops. That's when the British took it to the next level. They deployed their railgun tanks, which plowed through the Australian boulders. The railgun tanks destroyed the entire western side of Australia, and this made the natives very mad. The natives decided to colonize Britian using their exotic animals. They rode their giant birds through the air to the British mainland, and dropped a legion of bus sized turtles. The Australians and the British reached a peace deal soon after, and the turtles left Britian and the British left Australia.</p>
